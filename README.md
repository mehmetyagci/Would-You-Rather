## Would You Rather...?

Would You Rather is the second project for the Udacity React Nanodegree program. The application created using React, Redux, React Router, Semantic UI etc... This application is a recreation of the classic game, Would You Rather. A user can login and submit reponses to the number of different Would You Rather questions that have been asked. A user can also add new questions to be answered as well as see where they rank among all users on the questions asked/answered Leaderboards.

## Installation

In the project directory, you can run:

1. You have Node.js, npm and yarn installed.
2. Proceed with cloning or downloading the project as a zip.
3. Extract and change directory to the project folder.
4. Run `yarn install`
5. Then run `yarn start`
6. Your default browser should open at port 3000 with the address: http://localhost:3000
7. You should be connected to the Internet as the app accesses images (user avatars) and the Semantic-UI CSS file from a CDN.

For reference, this project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
